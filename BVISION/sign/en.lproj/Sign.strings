Arbitration is more\ninformal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a\nneutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for\nmore limited discovery than in court, and is subject to\nvery limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award\nthe same damages and relief that a court can\naward. Please visit www.adr.org for more\ninformation.\nII Commencing Arbitration. A party who intends to seek\narbitration must first send to the other, by a reputable\ncourier with a tracking mechanism, a written notice of\nintent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the absence of a\nmailing address provided by you to the Company, to\nyou via any other method available to the Company,\nincluding via e-mail. The Notice to the Company\nshould be addressed to: Legacy Direct LLC, 1221 E.\nDyer Road, Unit 110, Santa Ana, CA92705 Attn:\nMarshal Young Esq. – (myoung@mmnt.com) (the\n“Arbitration Notice Address”). The Notice must (i)\ndescribe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;\nand (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (the\n“Demand”). If you and the Company do not reach an\nagreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days\nafter the Notice is received, you or the Company may\ncommence an arbitration proceeding as set forth\nbelow or file a claim in small claims court. THE\nARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY JAMS\n(“JAMS”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE\nSTREAMLINED ARBITRATION RULES AND\nPROCEDURES OF JAMS OR SUBSEQUENT\nVERSIONS THEREOF, INCLUDING THE OPTIONAL\nAPPEAL PROCEDURE (THE “JAMS RULES”). The\nJams Rules and JAMS forms are available\nat www.jamsadr.com.\nIII Arbitration Proceeding. The arbitration will be\nconducted in English. A single independent and\nimpartial arbitrator with his or her primary place of\nbusiness in Los Angeles County, California will be\nappointed pursuant to the Jams Rules, as modified\nherein. You and the Company agree the following\nrules, which are intended to streamline the dispute\nresolution process and reduce the costs and burdens\non the parties: (i) the arbitration will be conducted\nonline and/or be solely based on written submissions,\nthe specific manner to be chosen by the party\ninitiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration will not\nrequire any personal appearance by the parties or\nwitnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing\nby the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award\nrendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court\nof competent jurisdiction.\nIV Equitable Relief; No Injunctive Relief. The foregoing\nprovisions of this Dispute Resolution Section do not\napply to any claim in which either party seeks\nequitable relief to protect such party’s intellectual\nproperty, including copyrights, trademarks, or\npatents. You acknowledge that, in the event the\nCompany or a third party breaches these Terms, the\ndamage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle\nyou to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against\nthe Company, and your only remedy will be for\nmonetary damages, subject to the limitations of\nliability set forth in these Terms.\nV Claims. You and the Company agree that,\nnotwithstanding any other rights the party may have\nunder law or equity, any cause of action arising out of\nor related to these Terms, or the Service, excluding a\nclaim for indemnification, must commence within one\n(1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise,\nsuch cause of action is permanently barred. All claims\nyou bring against the Company must be resolved in\naccordance with this Dispute Resolution Section. All\nclaims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute\nResolution Section will be considered improperly\nfiled. Should you file a claim contrary to this Dispute\nResolution Section, the Company may recover\nattorneys’ fees and costs up to five thousand dollars\n($5,000), provided that the Company has notified you\nin writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have\nfailed to promptly withdraw the claim.\nVI Terms Modifications. In the event that the Company\nmakes any future change to the Mandatory Arbitration\nprovision (other than a change to the Company’s\nArbitration Notice Address), you may reject any such\nchange by sending us written notice within 30 days of\nthe change to the Company’s Arbitration Notice\nAddress, in which case your Account and your license\nto use the Service hereunder will terminate\nimmediately.

Notwithstanding your purchase or\npossession of such Virtual Items, you acknowledge\nand agree that you do not in fact \"own\" the Virtual\nItems, and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not\nrefer to any credit balance of real currency or its\nequivalent.

Arbitration is more\ninformal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a\nneutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for\nmore limited discovery than in court, and is subject to\nvery limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award\nthe same damages and relief that a court can\naward. Please visit www.adr.org for more\ninformation.\nII Commencing Arbitration. A party who intends to seek\narbitration must first send to the other, by a reputable\ncourier with a tracking mechanism, a written notice of\nintent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the absence of a\nmailing address provided by you to the Company, to\nyou via any other method available to the Company,\nincluding via e-mail.

The Notice must (i)\ndescribe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;\nand (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (the\n“Demand”). If you and the Company do not reach an\nagreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days\nafter the Notice is received, you or the Company may\ncommence an arbitration proceeding as set forth\nbelow or file a claim in small claims court. THE\nARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY JAMS\n(“JAMS”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE\nSTREAMLINED ARBITRATION RULES AND\nPROCEDURES OF JAMS OR SUBSEQUENT\nVERSIONS THEREOF, INCLUDING THE OPTIONAL\nAPPEAL PROCEDURE (THE “JAMS RULES”). The\nJams Rules and JAMS forms are available\nat www.jamsadr.com.\nIII Arbitration Proceeding. The arbitration will be\nconducted in English. A single independent and\nimpartial arbitrator with his or her primary place of\nbusiness in Los Angeles County, California will be\nappointed pursuant to the Jams Rules, as modified\nherein. You and the Company agree the following\nrules, which are intended to streamline the dispute\nresolution process and reduce the costs and burdens\non the parties: (i) the arbitration will be conducted\nonline and/or be solely based on written submissions,\nthe specific manner to be chosen by the party\ninitiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration will not\nrequire any personal appearance by the parties or\nwitnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing\nby the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award\nrendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court\nof competent jurisdiction.\nIV Equitable Relief; No Injunctive Relief. The foregoing\nprovisions of this Dispute Resolution Section do not\napply to any claim in which either party seeks\nequitable relief to protect such party’s intellectual\nproperty, including copyrights, trademarks, or\npatents. You acknowledge that, in the event the\nCompany or a third party breaches these Terms, the\ndamage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle\nyou to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against\nthe Company, and your only remedy will be for\nmonetary damages, subject to the limitations of\nliability set forth in these Terms.\nV Claims. You and the Company agree that,\nnotwithstanding any other rights the party may have\nunder law or equity, any cause of action arising out of\nor related to these Terms, or the Service, excluding a\nclaim for indemnification, must commence within one\n(1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise,\nsuch cause of action is permanently barred. All claims\nyou bring against the Company must be resolved in\naccordance with this Dispute Resolution Section. All\nclaims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute\nResolution Section will be considered improperly\nfiled. Should you file a claim contrary to this Dispute\nResolution Section, the Company may recover\nattorneys’ fees and costs up to five thousand dollars\n($5,000), provided that the Company has notified you\nin writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have\nfailed to promptly withdraw the claim.\nVI Terms Modifications. In the event that the Company\nmakes any future change to the Mandatory Arbitration\nprovision (other than a change to the Company’s\nArbitration Notice Address), you may reject any such\nchange by sending us written notice within 30 days of\nthe change to the Company’s Arbitration Notice\nAddress, in which case your Account and your license\nto use the Service hereunder will terminate\nimmediately. This Dispute Resolution provision, as in\neffect immediately prior to the amendments you\nreject, will survive the termination of these Terms.\n13.
